so in this project we had to convert from any base we get from the user to decimal base and make more functions that converts from string to int, check if a number is bigger(max) for the most part and etc
and we also were to look at the original way the code is supposed to work in the teacher's work
and make it print the same way for any number we got from base 2 to 16
then we also had to use tests to see if our project works correctly
